### Why do RPGs Matter?

Role-playing games have long served as a bridge between narrative and interactivity, but in more recent years, their cultural importance seems to have only grown. Having generated as of 2024,$27.5 billion(USD), with a 10% growth rate, RPGs continue to be a significant part of the gaming industry with a [market estimation of generating](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/video-rpg-games-market-113473) $58.4 billion(USD) by 2033. Outside of the financial side of the gaming industry, at the heart of this emergence is what seems to be a growing demand from audiences **to not just observe these stories, but to actively inhabit them**. RPGs uniquely fulfill this need by placing players directly in the role of the character, allowing them to influence outcomes, build identities, overcome obstacles,and explore complexity of the world,that have been carefully and meticulously designed by the developers, on their own terms.

This shift aligns with the rise of interactive storytelling as a dominant force in media, where player agency and experiencing narrative consequences are valued over general passive consumption. From sprawling open worlds to tightly written visual novels, RPGs as well other genres of gaming reflect a broader movement toward experiential immersion, where gameplay and narrative are inextricably linked. As game designer [Warren Spector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Spector) once said, "Games are the only form of media where the audience is also the actor."

### The Rise of the LitRPG Literary Genre

The rise of the [LitRPG genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LitRPG) can be attributed to a number of factors. The emergence of the GameLit or LitRPG genres where characters are fully immersed in a measurable game-like world, parallels the growing popularity of RPGs in the growing gaming industry where ones efforts, arguably, correlate directly to the outcome of the game and the character's development over the course of time. These novels often feature in-world game mechanics, level or skill systems, and choice-driven progression, mirroring the structure and emotional impact derived from role-playing games themselves.

This literary movement began to take shape in the early 2000s with works like the [ .hack// video game series (2002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack_(video_game_series)), which introduced the “trapped in a game” premise. It drew further influence from massively multiplayer online games such as [World of Warcraft (2004)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft), and by around 2010 Russian authors, most notably Dmitry Rus and Vasily Mahanenko, were explicitly integrating game mechanics into their narratives, coining the term “LitRPG.” The genre entered the English-language mainstream with novels like [Ready Player One (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One) by Ernest Cline and [The Land: Founding (2015)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_(novel)) by Aleron Kong, and its evolution could also be  said to have been inspired by the immersive world-building of landmark games, as 3D gaming became more accessible in those early years by [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) and [Final Fantasy VII (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII). These and other genre titles resonated with the digital-native readers and players who grew up immersed in richly detailed worlds where player agency and emotional investment became central to their experience.

As both gaming and fiction continue to evolve towards more interactive, player-centric experiences, LitRPGs acts as a literary extension of what RPGs have always promised: the ability to live through a story, not just read or watch it unfold. So if you got that itch to play an RPG, but don't have the time to scratch it, or if you just want to enjoy the experience of gaming through these stories in a different way, LitRPGs are a great way to do so.
